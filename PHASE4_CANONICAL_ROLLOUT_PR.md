# Phase 4 Canonical Roll-out — Layer/Fabric + HoloFabric Activation

## 🔐 Canonical Authority Notice
This file finalizes Phase 4 of N3XUS v-COS and transitions the platform into full, irreversible production state.

All changes in this PR/PF are Canon-bound and Genesis-enforced.

---

## 🧬 Major Systems Introduced / Locked

### 1. v-COS Layer / Fabric Runtime (FOUNDATIONAL)
Native replacement for all external seed, bootstrap, and orchestration systems.

- Layers define what exists
- Fabrics define how it executes
- Phase-aware (P1–P4)
- Canon-locked post-Genesis

Active Layers:
- CoreLayer
- IMVULayer
- FranchiseLayer
- FintechLayer
- AIOperatorLayer
- HoloDesignLayer

Active Fabrics:
- InfraFabric
- RuntimeFabric
- CanonFabric
- SettlementFabric
- HoloManufactureFabric
- HoloDeployFabric

All seed-style tooling is permanently deprecated.

---

### 2. HOLOFABRIC™ System (End-to-End, Production)
A full digital-to-physical operating fabric for HoloSnap / HoloCore.

Includes:
- HoloDesign Layer (parametric design + simulation)
- HoloManufacture Fabric (BoM, batch lineage, fabrication runs)
- HoloDeploy Fabric (zero-touch provisioning, Canon lock on first boot)
- HoloSnap Runtime (device = IMVU execution node)
- HoloSettlement Fabric (device-level wallets + revenue splits)
- Canon Hardware Lock (no re-seeding, no drift)

---

### 3. IMVU System (v-COS Native Content Objects)
Replaces Film / TV / Audio terminology entirely.

- IMVU (Root)
- IMVU-L (Live / Episodic)
- IMVU-S (Short / Atomic)

Each IMVU is Canon-signed, Franchise-aware, Monetization-bound, AI-operable, and Device-deployable.

---

### 4. Franchise + FinTech Lock
- Franchise inheritance enforced
- Spin-offs are non-forkable
- Wallets bound to IMVUs, devices, and franchises
- Immutable settlement post-Genesis

---

## 🖥 Infrastructure & Deployment
- Activates docker-compose.full.yml
- Rebuilds all services with updated Dockerfiles
- Resolves stale container healthcheck failures
- Launches full Phase 1–4 stack

Authorized execution command:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose.full.yml up -d --build
```

---

## 📜 Genesis Settlement
Upon successful deployment:
- Phase 4 becomes immutable
- Canon authority enforced
- All future changes require Canon versioning and settlement delta

---

## ✅ Checklist
- [x] Phase 4 Canon Manifest included
- [x] Layer/Fabric runtime activated
- [x] HoloFabric system declared
- [x] IMVU schemas finalized
- [x] Franchise + FinTech locked
- [x] Full-stack rebuild enabled
- [x] Genesis Settlement conditions met
