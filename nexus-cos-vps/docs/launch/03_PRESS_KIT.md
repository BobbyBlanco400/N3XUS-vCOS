## 🎙️ Quotes

**From the Architect:**
> "We didn't build a better YouTube. We built a better internet for creators. N3XUS is about sovereignty. It's about owning the pipes, not just the water flowing through them."

**From "Club Saditty" (Founding Resident):**
> "Finally, I'm not just a channel number. I'm a CEO of my own media company, running on N3XUS infrastructure."
